Brief Summary
This Repository is a showcase and partial tutorial of the Ironman Helmet I am in progress of creating.
This idea stemmed from an Ontario Youtuber "The Hacksmith" where they created their own Ironman Helmet and I thought I should give it a shot and add my own twist.

I wanted to add object detection into my helmet to differentiate my helmet from theirs and possibly provide a way to detect road hazards for motorcyclists.
In my pursuit of this, this helmet has evolved to a more computer focused idea. It will still detect cars, however I wanted to instead be able to control my Laptop from within the 
helmet.
With the help of the guides from medium and EdjeElectronics I have been able to mostly complete this project.

I am currently in progress of adding mouse functionality to the helmet, once that is done I will be writing a full guide on how to set it up and a youtube video with demonstration
